1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- Disable SSH access to the web application instance.

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

- Creating VPC private endpoints for S3 will not prevent unauthorized access.

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

- Enabling default encryption doesn't change the encryption of objects that are already in the bucket. 

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?

- Those changes would be overriden by cloud formation.
