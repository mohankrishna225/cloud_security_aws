## Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

The IAM policy is not restrictive, allowing full administrative access.
The Loadbalancer does not redirect HTTP to HTTPS requests.
There's no IAM password policy
CloudTrail Trail is not specified.
S3 bucket logging not enabled.
VPC Security Groups allow all ingress and egress traffic.
There's direct access from the public internet to the application listening on port 5000
Logging is not enabled for the S3 buckets

## Recommendations to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Set IAM policy to readonly.
Enable MFA for root access.
Have a strong IAM password policy.
Limit traffic on the Loadbalancer.
Disable unnecessary port access to the EC2 instance.
Enable logging for S3 buckets.
Traffic should only be allowed from security groups.
Create a CloudTrail that is stored on S3.
